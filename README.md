This is a streamlit weather classification app. Users can upload images associated with weather, and the model will provide predictions. While the model's accuracy may not be perfect, it still fulfills its intended purpose effectively.

The model came from the midterm exam, and I made only a few changes so that the model size could be uploaded on GitHub.
