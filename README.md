# About
This is a streamlit weather classification app. Users can upload images associated with weather, and the model will provide predictions. While the model's accuracy may not be perfect, it still fulfills its intended purpose effectively. 

Model Origin: To ensure that the model could be uploaded on GitHub, I made only a few modifications to the original version that originated from the midterm exam.
